50% of the test will be used for the public leaderboard, while the other 50% will be used for the final private leaderboard.

The used metric will be weighted categorization accuracy with weightning for each class in order to take into account class imbalance.

# Special prize things to consider 

For those of you who don't necessarily seek very high scores in the leaderboard and are interesting in winning the Sparktech special prize there are the following things to consider in order to maximize your chances of winning that prize.

They will look into part of your results as well (considering the score you obtained and your position in the leaderboard), but more importantly they will evaluate the following criterias:

- The manner in which you preprocessed the data

- Making use of smart feature engineering

- Your selection of algorithms and the way you made use of them

- how rigorously you evaluated and compared your solutions?

- How much time it took to train your model? How about the average model training and inference time

- Other unique and creative ideas you had during the competition, also make sure to shine a light upon all of them during the presentation. Are there any of them which would be worth mentioning?

Last but not least, the way in which you are going to present, explain and go through all of these questions during your presentation from next weekend will definitely matter decisively.
