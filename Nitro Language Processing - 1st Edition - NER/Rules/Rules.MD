This is a page where you can include rules that participants must accept before joining. 

#### General rules:

- The announcements will mainly be made on Discord, but also on the associated social networks and emails of the participants. - The hackathon site will be constantly updated with general information;

- Each team is entitled to JUST 20 submissions per calendar day (the counting of submissions will be reset at midnight UTC, so 02:00 AM EET (Romania's Time Zone);

- You will have to select 3 out of all your submissions which will be considered for the final private leaderboard evaluation. Bear in mind that if you don’t choose those 3 submissions, by default the platform will select the top 3 submissions of yours.

- The 23 hour time frame in which participants can submit solutions begins on March 26h at 10AM and ends at 10AM on March 27th., Romanian time (including the transition to daylight saving time);

- The ranking can be viewed in real time on Kaggle, but competitors should not have access to the solutions of others;

- At least one member of the organizing team and the jury will be available throughout the hackathon both for general information about the competition and on time if they have any questions about the given task;

- Creating multiple accounts in order to increase the number of your submissions to more than the allowed maximum will lead to DISQUALIFICATION;

- Sharing the competition link outside the competition or inviting people from outside to participate will lead to DISQUALIFICATION;

- Only persons / teams registered in the hackathon will be eligible for prizes;

- There is no deadline for the entry in the competition;

- Participants must use their full name (first name + last name) when joining the competition;

- Annotation of the test data might lead to DISQUALIFICATION;



#### Rules about the teams:

- Teams can have between 2 and 4 members and will have a representative;

- Team members must be students enrolled in a high school in Romania or in the bachelor's program of a Romanian college (we do not currently accept students enrolled in a master's / doctorate);

-  Team mergings are NOT allowed between teams, but should exist inside teams (the team leader is the one responsible for initiating the team merging with his/her colleagues);


#### Cooperation during the hackathon:

- Collaboration between teams is strictly FORBIDDEN on any communication platform. Remember this is a contest and you can hurt yourself if you solve the problem together with another team;

- External communications related to the completion of the task are PROHIBITED;

- It is not allowed to publish on the Internet or distribute publicly or privately some code snippets, submissions or opinions related to the task during the hackathon;

- Violation of any of the above provisions will result in DISQUALIFICATION from the competition;


#### What CAN NOT be used during the hackathon?    

- Use paid APIs such as GPT3, or those provided through AWS, Google Cloud, Azure.

- Copy or reuse code from other Kaggle competitions.


#### Submission details:

- Each team will have only one account (trying to create multiple accounts leads to disqualification);

- Any external sources (articles, books, repositories, etc.) used in the sources chosen for submission must be mentioned using comments where the code was written based on these sources;

- At the end of the competition, the code with which the chosen submissions were made must be sent (we recommend that participants note on Kaggle for each submission a description of the code used for that submission. Kaggle descriptions are private, so there is no risk of being seen by the other participants). If you are not sure which code you used for the submissions you chose, it’s better to send all the code, you should also ensure the REPRODUCIBILITY of your results;

- The code must be sent no later than 10:15 EET 27th of March (Romania's timezone), 30 minutes after the deadline for the last submission;

- The submission archive must contain .py and .ipynb files.Besides the code itself, a requirements.txt or requirements.yml file in order for us to be able to reproduce your results. You can use either one of the following commands to generate your requirements file: pip freeze > requirements.txt or conda list -e > requirements.txt. If you are eligible for a prize we might need to contact you if we encounter errors in running your code. Optionally you can add any other explanatory documents like a readme (if you wish);

- If you worked on a remote computing resource such as Kaggle Notebooks or Google Colab, please download the files as .ipynb’s and add them in the archive. You should not send us links to your code.

- If you create a notebook on Kaggle Notebooks / Google Colab, please keep them private;

- The submission of the code will be done through a single Google Form (you can't submit multiple solutions), at the end of which you can choose whether you want the solution to be published open-source or not;

- At 10:30, after the submission deadline and a short break, the Hackathon closing event will be made on the general channel.


#### Final evaluation procedures:

- The code will be evaluated by a committee that will ensure that there are no suspicions of plagiarism leading to the disqualification of the team (if there are any suspicions it will be discussed with those teams, and if one / more teams should be eliminated, then the ranking will be updated);

- The final results will be announced the weekend after the competition, April 2-3, when the presentations will take place; Only the first 3 places depending on the score will be considered for prizes (a test of statistical significance might be performed if the results are very CLOSE).


#### Other details:

- The organizing team is not responsible for any malfunctions of third parties or their systems (ex: power outage or internet connection resulting in failure to submit on time, etc.);

- The organizing team is not responsible for the distribution of the prizes after the competition ends. 

- The organizing team will be held responsible for the situation in which the winner does not take possession of the prize due to causes beyond its competence or incorrect / incomplete completion of the identification data, as well as in case the designated winner cannot be validated, due to the exact and timely failure of the above procedure.
